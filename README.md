# Inventory Application

This is an **inventory** **management** application built using **Node.js**, **Nest.js**, **TypeScript**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to track and manage their inventory, including adding, updating, and deleting items.

## Best Practices
#### This application follows best practices for software development, including:

- **Logging**: The application uses the default nestjs logger for logging, with different log levels for different types of messages.

- **Caching**: The application uses the redis library for caching, to improve performance and reduce the load on the database.

- **Tests**: The application includes a comprehensive test suite using Jest, with unit tests for the key components of the application.
